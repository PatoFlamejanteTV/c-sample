# Sample C/C++ Visual Studio Code Project

This is taken from the [VSC docs page](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-linux)

It demonstrates
* Using the GIT repository
  * the ``.gitignore`` file
* Setting the ``.vscode/tasks.json`` file to build C and C++ files
* Setting ``.vscode/launch.json`` to run a debug session on the executable
