# Sample C/C++ Visual Studio Code Project

This is taken from the [VSC docs page](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-linux)

It demonstrates
* Using the GIT repository
  * the ``.gitignore`` file
* Setting the ``.vscode/tasks.json`` file to build C and C++ files
* Setting ``.vscode/launch.json`` to run a debug session on the executable
* Using Make to build your program
  * defining a ``Makefile`` to compile and link the program, based on the file extension
  * can make it easier to produce both the program, and the unit tests
* Adding a Unit Test framework
  * [Cgreen](https://github.com/cgreen-devs/cgreen) looks promising
  * [Documentation](https://github.com/cgreen-devs/cgreen/releases)
  * DEB package is available from their [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/cgreen-devs/cgreen/releases)
